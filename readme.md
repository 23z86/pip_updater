## **Why this project**
I was looking for an UI based pip application<br>
and didn't find one so I decided to write my own.

## **Project elements**
The project is based on Flask, Python for the backend,<br>
some HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the front-end.<br>
Semantic-UI is used as a framework.<br>

## **How to start**
- double-click the **main.py**. This will start a local server.
- open your browser and enter the ip address shown in the console.
- search for your packages by pressing the refresh button on the top left
- all outdated packages will be shown in the table

## **How to use**
Press on the "Update" button to start the update.<br>
You can trigger multiple updates at the same time.
